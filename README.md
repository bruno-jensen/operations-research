# operations-research

My name is Bruno, I`m a Brazilian engineer and expert in operations research.

In this repository, I publish some Operations Research projects I have made since 2006. Most of the mathematical models are implemented in GAMS, and some use real data. There are some heuristics and MIP Heuristics available too. Time to time, I will publish more from my personal library.

Use them as you want however, remember aways give credit to this repository.

Best regards,
